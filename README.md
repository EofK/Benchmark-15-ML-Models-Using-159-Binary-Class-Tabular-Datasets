# Benchmark-15-ML-Models-Using-159-Binary-Class-Tabular-Datasets
This study benchmarks 15 machine learning models on 159 tabular datasets for binary classification to answer four questions: (1) Which models perform best overall? (2) What makes datasets difficult to classify? (3) Which models handle specific complexity types most effectively? (4) How do accuracy and speed trade off across models?
